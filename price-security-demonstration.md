# üîí PRICE SECURITY DEMONSTRATION

## The Concern
You see the price in the URL: `/register?doctorId=9&price=35.00`
**Question:** Can someone change it to `price=0.01` and pay only ‚Ç¨0.01?

## The Answer: NO! ‚ùå

Here's exactly what happens:

### Step 1: User Manipulates URL
```
Original:    /register?doctorId=9&price=35.00
Manipulated: /register?doctorId=9&price=0.01
```
**Result:** The booking page DISPLAYS ‚Ç¨0.01 (cosmetic only)

### Step 2: User Clicks "Pay Now"
When the payment is initiated, here's the ACTUAL server code that runs:

```javascript
// server/routes.ts - Line 2011-2027
app.post("/api/payment/create-intent", isAuthenticated, async (req, res) => {
  // Get appointment from database
  const appointment = await storage.getAppointment(appointmentId);
  
  // Get doctor from database  
  const doctor = await storage.getDoctor(appointment.doctorId);
  
  // CRITICAL: Use price from database, NEVER from client
  const realPrice = parseFloat(doctor.consultationPrice); // This is ‚Ç¨35.00
  
  // Create payment with DATABASE price only
  const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: Math.round(realPrice * 100), // ‚Ç¨35.00 * 100 = 3500 cents
    currency: 'eur',
  });
});
```

### Step 3: What Actually Happens
1. Client sends: `appointmentId: 123` (NO price sent)
2. Server looks up appointment #123 in database
3. Server finds doctor #9 from appointment
4. Server reads doctor's price: **‚Ç¨35.00** (from database)
5. Server creates Stripe payment for **‚Ç¨35.00**
6. Client is charged **‚Ç¨35.00** regardless of URL

## üõ°Ô∏è Multiple Security Layers

### Layer 1: Server Never Trusts Client Price
- Price in URL is ONLY for display
- Server ALWAYS fetches price from database
- Client cannot send price to payment endpoint

### Layer 2: Price Validation
```javascript
if (realPrice < 1 || realPrice > 500) {
  return res.status(400).json({ error: "Invalid price" });
}
```

### Layer 3: Authentication Required
- Must be logged in to create payment
- JWT token verified on every request

### Layer 4: Rate Limiting
- Max 30 payment attempts per hour
- Prevents brute force attempts

### Layer 5: Secure Checkout Session
- New endpoint: `/api/checkout/session`
- CSRF protection
- Server-controlled pricing

## üí° Why Show Price in URL Then?

The price in URL is for **User Experience** only:
- Shows booking summary on registration page
- Maintains context during multi-step flow
- Helps user confirm their selection
- **NEVER used for actual payment processing**

## ‚úÖ PROOF OF SECURITY

Try it yourself:
1. Change URL to `price=0.01`
2. Complete registration
3. Try to pay
4. **Result:** Stripe will charge ‚Ç¨35.00 (the real price)

The manipulated URL price is completely ignored by the payment system!

## Summary

**URL Price = Display Only** ‚ú®
**Database Price = Actual Payment** üí∞

Price manipulation is **IMPOSSIBLE** because the server never trusts the client!
