```sql
SELECT
  id,
  trigger_code,
  status,
  error_message,
  sent_at,
  created_at
FROM email_notifications
WHERE user_id = 309
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Check Specific Appointment Notifications

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  trigger_code,
  user_id,
  status,
  error_message,
  sent_at,
  created_at
FROM email_notifications

```sql
SELECT
  appointment_id,
  trigger_code,
  user_id,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM email_notifications
WHERE user_id = 309
GROUP BY appointment_id, trigger_code, user_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Expected: 0 rows (no duplicates)
```

### Check for ICS Errors

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  trigger_code,
  error_message,
  created_at
FROM email_notifications
WHERE trigger_code = 'B3'
