# Alternative Approach: Using Direct Replit API

Since the standard OAuth configuration with redirect URIs isn't available in your Replit setup, we have a few alternative approaches:

## Option 1: Use Replit's Built-in Authentication (Current Approach)
- Keep the existing OAuth setup but accept that the preview screen might appear briefly
- Focus on making the redirect logic robust so users still get to the right place
- This is what we currently have implemented

## Option 2: Custom Authentication Implementation
- Implement a custom authentication system using Replit's API directly
- This would require more setup but gives full control over the flow

## Option 3: Accept the Preview Screen
- Many applications on Replit show this brief preview screen
- Users typically understand this is part of the authentication flow
- We can optimize the redirect logic to minimize the delay

## Current Status
The current implementation should work, even with the brief preview screen. The key is that after authentication, users should be redirected to the correct page (/dashboard or /payment).

Let's test the current flow to see if it works despite the preview screen.
