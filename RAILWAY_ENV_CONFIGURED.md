# Railway Environment Variables - Configuration Confirmed

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Status:** ✅ CLIENT_URL CONFIGURED

---

## Confirmed Configuration

Railway environment variables are correctly configured:

```
CLIENT_URL = https://doktu.co
```

Screenshot evidence: Railway dashboard shows CLIENT_URL in service variables.

---

## Current Issue

Even though `CLIENT_URL` is configured and our code fixes are committed:
- Commit 467ec47: Bitdefender fix ✅
- Commit e784abb: Use CLIENT_URL instead of FRONTEND_URL ✅
- Commit dc9eb0c: Fix template to use verification_link ✅

**The registration emails still show `undefined/verify-email`** because Railway hasn't deployed the latest code yet.

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Wait for Auto-Deployment (Recommended)
Railway should auto-deploy when you push to main. The latest commit (dc9eb0c) should trigger deployment automatically.

### Option 2: Manually Trigger Deployment
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy" on the latest commit
4. Wait ~2-3 minutes for build to complete

### Option 3: Force Redeploy
Make a small change to trigger deployment:
```bash
# Add a comment to trigger redeploy
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger Railway redeploy"
git push
```

---

## Verification

Once deployment completes:
1. Check Railway deployment logs show commit `dc9eb0c`
2. Test registration with temp email
3. Verification link should be: `https://doktu.co/verify`

---

## Summary

- ✅ Environment variable configured correctly
- ✅ Code fixes committed and pushed
- ⏳ **Waiting for Railway to deploy latest code**

The registration will work correctly once Railway deploys commit dc9eb0c.
