**Security Assessment:** Test suite is comprehensive and covers OWASP Top 10. Execution blocked by registration endpoint issue.

### 3.2 API Validation Tests (Manual)

| Test ID | Endpoint | Method | Status | Response | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| API-001 | /api/health | GET | ✅ PASS | 200 OK | Server healthy |
| API-002 | /api/doctor-registration/eligible-countries | GET | ✅ PASS | 200 OK | Returns 34 countries |

## 6. CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT

### 6.1 Backend Implementation Review

**Files Reviewed:**
- `server/routes/doctorRegistration.ts` (378 lines)

---

## 9. DETAILED FAILURE ANALYSIS

### Failure #1: Doctor Registration Endpoint

**Test ID:** API-003
**Priority:** P0 (CRITICAL)
**Status:** ❌ FAILED

**Expected Behavior:**
- POST request with valid doctor data should return 201 Created
- Response should include `doctorId`, `userId`, `email`, `status: 'pending_review'`
- Email notification should be queued
- Audit log entry should be created

**Actual Behavior:**
- Server returns 500 Internal Server Error
- Error response: `{"error": "Internal server error", "code": "INTERNAL_ERROR"}`

**Root Cause:**
Unknown - requires server log inspection.

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Database Schema Mismatch:**
   - `doctors` table may be missing required columns (status, countries, profileCompletionPercentage)
   - Check: Run `SELECT * FROM doctors LIMIT 1` to verify schema

2. **Supabase Auth Issue:**
   - `supabase.auth.signUp()` may be failing
   - Check: Verify SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY permissions
   - Check: Verify email domain restrictions in Supabase dashboard

3. **Email Service Error:**
   - SendGrid notification scheduling may be failing
   - Check: Verify SENDGRID_API_KEY is valid
   - Note: Error should be caught and logged, not cause 500

4. **Missing Fields in Request:**
   - Code expects fields that weren't provided
   - Check: Validate request body matches interface

**Recommended Fix Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Check server logs
tail -f server-logs.txt

# 2. Test database schema
psql -c "SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='doctors';"

# 3. Test Supabase auth independently
curl -X POST https://your-supabase-url.co/auth/v1/signup \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'

# 4. Add detailed logging
console.log('Request body:', req.body);
console.log('Supabase response:', authData);
```

**Retest Criteria:**
- ✅ Registration endpoint returns 201 Created
- ✅ Doctor record created in database with status 'pending_review'
- ✅ User record created in database
- ✅ Audit log entry created
- ✅ Email notification queued (check logs)
- ✅ Response includes all expected fields

**Report Generated:** 2025-10-14 16:15:00 UTC
**Report Version:** 1.0
**Next Review:** After P0 issue resolution

---

## CONCLUSION

The Doctor Registration feature has been comprehensively analyzed and tested to the extent possible given the blocking P0 issue. The implementation shows good code quality with proper security measures, but cannot be deployed until the registration endpoint error is resolved and full test suite execution confirms all functionality works as expected.

**Recommendation:** Allocate 1 business day for fixes and validation before scheduling deployment.
