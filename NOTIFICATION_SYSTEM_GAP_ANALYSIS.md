## 8. 📝 TESTING SCRIPTS TO CREATE

### Priority 1: Core Feature Testing

```bash
# 1. Appointment lifecycle complete test
/c/Users/mings/.apps/DoktuTracker/test-appointment-lifecycle-complete.mjs

# Test flow:
# - Create booking (trigger B1 payment pending banner)
# - Complete payment (trigger B3 confirmation + .ics)
# - Wait for 24h reminder (trigger B4 + verify .ics)
# - Wait for 1h reminder (trigger B5)
# - Wait for 5min reminder (trigger B6)
# - Join consultation
# - Wait 60 minutes (trigger G6 post-consultation survey)
# - Verify all emails received, links work, .ics imports correctly
```

```bash
# 2. Membership complete lifecycle test
/c/Users/mings/.apps/DoktuTracker/test-membership-complete-lifecycle.mjs

# Test flow:
# - Activate membership (trigger M1)
# - Use 1st visit (trigger M8 "1 left")
# - Use 2nd visit (trigger M9 "exhausted")
# - Wait for renewal (trigger M2 "upcoming in 3 days")
# - Simulate payment failure (trigger M4)
# - Simulate 2nd failure (trigger M5 suspension)
# - Update payment (trigger M7 reactivation)
# - Wait for monthly reset (trigger M10)
```

```bash
# 3. Multi-channel verification test
/c/Users/mings/.apps/DoktuTracker/test-multi-channel-delivery.mjs

# Test each trigger across all channels:
# - Email delivery + content + links
# - SMS delivery (if configured)
# - Push notification (if configured)
# - In-app banner appearance + priority
# - In-app inbox persistence
```

---

### Priority 2: Edge Case Testing

```bash
# 4. Timezone edge case test
/c/Users/mings/.apps/DoktuTracker/test-timezone-edge-cases.mjs

# Test scenarios:
# - User in UTC-12, doctor in UTC+14
# - Appointment during DST transition
# - User changes timezone before appointment
# - Verify all reminder times correct in user local time
```

```bash
# 5. Cancellation policy test
/c/Users/mings/.apps/DoktuTracker/test-cancellation-policies.mjs

# Test scenarios:
# - Cancel ≥60 minutes before (trigger B8, credit restored)
# - Cancel <60 minutes before (trigger B9, credit consumed)
# - Doctor cancels (trigger B10, patient credit restored)
# - Verify policy messages correct
```

```bash
# 6. No-show workflow test
/c/Users/mings/.apps/DoktuTracker/test-no-show-workflow.mjs

# Test scenarios:
# - Doctor doesn't join (trigger B11, admin notified)
# - Patient doesn't join (trigger B12, doctor compensated)
# - Verify admin receives alerts
# - Verify policy application
```

---

### Priority 3: Growth & Engagement Testing

```bash
# 7. Re-engagement campaign test
/c/Users/mings/.apps/DoktuTracker/test-re-engagement-campaigns.mjs

# Test scenarios:
# - User inactive for 30 days (trigger G4)
# - User inactive for 90 days (trigger G5)
# - Verify send time (09:00 user local time)
# - Verify 10% discount code generation
```

```bash
# 8. Membership upsell test
/c/Users/mings/.apps/DoktuTracker/test-membership-upsell.mjs

# Test scenarios:
# - User books 2 PPV appointments in 30 days (trigger G10)
# - Verify savings calculation accurate
# - Verify upsell sent within 24h of 2nd booking
# - Track conversion rate
```

## 9. 🎯 SUMMARY & NEXT STEPS

### Current State: 60% Complete

**Strengths:**
- ✅ All trigger codes defined (55 total)
- ✅ Priority-based notification system working
- ✅ Multi-channel architecture in place
- ✅ Critical appointment reminders deployed (B4, B5, B6)
- ✅ Post-consultation survey working (G6)
- ✅ Password reset flow tested and working (A3)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Only 5/55 triggers fully tested (9%)
- ❌ No .ics calendar attachments in emails
- ❌ No quiet hours enforcement
- ❌ No frequency caps enforcement
- ❌ No re-engagement cron jobs (G4, G5)
- ❌ No admin monitoring dashboard (X1-X5)
- ❌ No external calendar sync (C3-C5)

---

### Immediate Priorities (This Sprint)

**Week 1-2: Testing & Bug Fixes**
1. ✅ Create comprehensive test suites for all categories
2. ✅ Test membership lifecycle end-to-end (M1-M10)
3. ✅ Test appointment cancellation policies (B8, B9, B10)
4. ✅ Add .ics attachments to confirmation and reminder emails
5. ✅ Verify all email links use production CLIENT_URL

**Week 3-4: Missing Critical Features**
1. ✅ Implement quiet hours (22:00-08:00 SMS/Push suppression)
2. ✅ Implement frequency caps (1 marketing/week, 3 lifecycle/week)
3. ✅ Create re-engagement cron jobs (G4, G5)
4. ✅ Create doctor daily digest cron job (D2)
5. ✅ Test membership upsell detection (G10)

**Week 5-6: Advanced Features**
1. ✅ External calendar integration (C3-C5)
2. ✅ Admin monitoring dashboard (X1-X5)
3. ✅ Notification analytics dashboard
4. ✅ A/B testing framework

### Success Definition

**Phase 1 Complete (2 weeks):**
- 100% of appointment flow tested (B1-B12)
- 100% of membership flow tested (M1-M10)
- .ics attachments working in all email clients
- Zero critical bugs in production notifications

**Phase 2 Complete (4 weeks):**
- Quiet hours enforced for SMS/Push
- Frequency caps enforced for marketing/lifecycle
- Re-engagement campaigns running (G4, G5)
- 30-day inactive users returning at 10% rate

**Phase 3 Complete (6 weeks):**
- External calendar sync working (Google, Apple)
- Admin dashboard showing real-time notification health
- Notification open rate ≥30%
- Zero duplicate notifications

---

### Final Recommendation

**Proceed with phased approach:**

1. **Test existing features first** (highest ROI, lowest risk)
   - Many features already implemented but untested
   - Testing reveals bugs faster than building new features
   - Builds confidence in notification system reliability

2. **Add missing critical features** (quiet hours, frequency caps)
   - PRD compliance requirements
   - Prevents user fatigue and unsubscribes
   - Professional-grade notification system

3. **Build advanced features last** (calendar sync, admin dashboard)
   - High effort, lower immediate user impact
   - Can be rolled out gradually
   - Requires more infrastructure (OAuth, analytics)

**Estimated Timeline:**
- Phase 1 (Testing): 2 weeks
- Phase 2 (Critical Features): 2 weeks
- Phase 3 (Advanced Features): 2 weeks
- **Total: 6 weeks to full PRD compliance**
