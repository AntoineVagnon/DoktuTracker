1. **Database** (PostgreSQL via Supabase)
   - `doctor_documents` table (20 columns, 5 indexes)
   - Foreign keys to doctors and users tables
   - Verification status tracking
   - Audit trail

2. **Backend** (Node.js + Express)
   - 7 RESTful API endpoints
   - File upload via Multer
   - Supabase Storage integration
   - Signed URL generation
   - Role-based access control

3. **Frontend** (React + TypeScript)
   - 4 major components
   - React Query for data fetching
   - react-dropzone for uploads
   - shadcn/ui component library

---

## Security Features

### Storage Security
- ✅ All buckets set to PRIVATE
- ✅ Signed URLs with 1-hour expiration
- ✅ Service role key for backend access
- ✅ No direct file URL exposure

### Access Control
- ✅ Doctors can only access own documents
- ✅ Admins can access all documents
- ✅ Patients cannot access doctor credentials
- ✅ Authentication required for all endpoints

### File Validation
- ✅ Client-side: Type and size validation
- ✅ Server-side: Multer validation
- ✅ Allowed types: PDF, JPG, PNG only
- ✅ Max size: 10MB enforced

## What Happens Next?

### Automatic (No Action Required)
1. ✅ Vercel will auto-deploy from git push
2. ✅ New routes will be available immediately
3. ✅ Doctor registration will redirect to upload page

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Test the complete flow** (registration → upload → dashboard)
2. **Verify admin interface** works for document review
3. **Monitor for any errors** in Vercel/Railway logs
4. **Test with real PDF files** (not just test files)
5. **Verify email notifications** (future enhancement)
