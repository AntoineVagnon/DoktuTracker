# Database Operational Requirements
## Elderly Care Management Platform

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 2025
**Database:** PostgreSQL 15 (RDS Multi-AZ)
**Compliance:** BSI C5:2020 Type 2, §630f BGB, GoBD

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines quantified operational requirements for the Elderly Care Management Platform database. These Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) are **contractual commitments** that guide infrastructure provisioning, monitoring, and incident response.

**Key Targets:**
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** 4 hours
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** 15 minutes
- **Availability SLO:** 99.9% (43.8 minutes downtime/month)
- **Query Latency (p95):** <100ms for high-frequency queries
- **Billing Export:** <60 seconds for monthly export

---

## 1. Disaster Recovery Objectives

### **1.1 Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**

**Definition:** Maximum acceptable downtime after database failure.

**Target: 4 hours**

**Justification:**
```
Business Impact Analysis:
  0-4 hours: Caregivers use paper logs (emergency fallback)
    - Impact: Reduced efficiency (20% slower)
    - Patient safety: Maintained (paper backup proven in drills)

  4-24 hours: Medication errors increase (no photo verification)
    - Impact: Patient safety risk (5% error rate increase)
    - Compliance: GoBD audit trail gap (unacceptable)

  >24 hours: Critical patient safety risk
    - Impact: UNACCEPTABLE (potential patient harm)
    - Legal: §630f BGB violation (no medical record access)
```

**Current Architecture Meets Target:**
| Failure Scenario | Recovery Method | RTO | Meets 4h? |
|------------------|----------------|-----|-----------|
| AZ Failure (Frankfurt AZ-a) | Multi-AZ RDS automatic failover to AZ-b | **<5 minutes** | ✅ YES |
| Database Corruption | Point-in-time recovery from snapshot | **<2 hours** | ✅ YES |
| Region Failure (eu-central-1) | Manual promotion of eu-west-1 read replica | **<4 hours** | ✅ YES |
| Human Error (DROP TABLE) | Point-in-time recovery to pre-error timestamp | **<2 hours** | ✅ YES |

### **1.2 Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**

**Definition:** Maximum acceptable data loss after database failure.

**Target: 15 minutes**

**Justification:**
```
Data Criticality Assessment:
  Medication logs: ZERO tolerance (patient safety)
  Audit logs: ZERO tolerance (GoBD legal requirement)
  User messages: 30 minutes acceptable
  Notifications: 1 hour acceptable

  Weighted average: 15 minutes RPO
```

**Current Architecture Meets Target:**
| Failure Scenario | Data Loss | RPO | Meets 15m? |
|------------------|-----------|-----|------------|
| AZ Failure | **<1 minute** (synchronous replication Multi-AZ) | **<1 min** | ✅ YES |
| Database Corruption | **<5 minutes** (transaction log backups every 5 min) | **<5 min** | ✅ YES |
| Region Failure | **<30 seconds** (asynchronous replication to eu-west-1) | **<30 sec** | ✅ YES |
| Accidental DELETE | **<5 minutes** (point-in-time recovery granularity) | **<5 min** | ✅ YES |

## 2. Backup & Retention Strategy

### **2.1 Backup Tiers (Hot/Warm/Cold)**

```yaml
Hot Data (0-3 years):
  Storage: RDS Multi-AZ Standard SSD (gp3)
  Backup Method: RDS automated snapshots (daily)
  Retention: 35 days (maximum allowed)
  Recovery Time: <1 hour (restore from snapshot)
  Cost: €200/month (db.t3.large Multi-AZ)

Warm Data (3-7 years):
  Storage: RDS snapshot exported to S3 Standard
  Backup Method: Monthly manual snapshots
  Retention: 10 years (§630f BGB)
  Recovery Time: <4 hours (restore snapshot, then import to RDS)
  Cost: €5/month (50 GB × €0.10/GB)

Cold Data (7-10 years):
  Storage: S3 Glacier Deep Archive
  Backup Method: Annual archival
  Retention: 10 years minimum
  Recovery Time: 12-48 hours (Glacier retrieval)
  Cost: €0.50/month (50 GB × €0.01/GB)
```

### **2.2 Backup Schedule**

```yaml
RDS Automated Backups:
  Frequency: Daily at 3:00 AM CET (low-traffic window)
  Retention: 35 days (maximum RDS retention)
  Transaction Logs: Continuous backup (every 5 minutes)
  Point-in-Time Recovery: Any second within 35-day window

Manual Snapshots (Long-Term Archive):
  Frequency: Monthly (1st day of each month)
  Retention: 10 years (compliance requirement)
  Storage Transition:
    - 0-3 years: Keep in RDS snapshot
    - 3-7 years: Export to S3 Standard
    - 7-10 years: Migrate to S3 Glacier Deep Archive
  Cost: €60/year (10 years × €0.50/month)

Backup Testing:
  Frequency: Quarterly (every 3 months)
  Procedure:
    1. Restore latest snapshot to test RDS instance
    2. Run verify_audit_chain() function (validate integrity)
    3. Validate random sample of 5 resident profiles
    4. Document restore time (target: <60 minutes)
    5. Destroy test instance (cost control)
  Owner: DevOps Engineer + DBA
  Documentation: Restore test report in Confluence
```

### **2.3 Cross-Region Disaster Recovery**

```yaml
Read Replica (DR):
  Region: eu-west-1 (Frankfurt → Ireland)
  Replication: Asynchronous (PostgreSQL streaming replication)
  Replication Lag: <30 seconds (target), <60 seconds (acceptable)
  Cost: €200/month (db.t3.large replica)

Failover Procedure (Region-Level DR):
  Scenario: Entire eu-central-1 region unavailable (AWS outage)

  Manual Failover Steps:
    1. Verify primary region down (>15 minutes outage)
    2. Promote eu-west-1 read replica to primary (AWS RDS Console)
       - Command: aws rds promote-read-replica --db-instance-identifier elderly-care-dr
    3. Update DNS (Route53):
       - Change elderly-care-db.example.com CNAME → new primary endpoint
       - TTL: 60 seconds (fast propagation)
    4. Notify application:
       - Update DATABASE_URL environment variable
       - Restart API servers (rolling restart, zero downtime)
    5. Verify:
       - Run health check: SELECT 1; (confirm connectivity)
       - Check replication lag: SELECT pg_last_wal_receive_lsn();

  RTO: <4 hours (manual promotion + DNS propagation + testing)
  RPO: <30 seconds (replication lag before failure)

  Rollback Procedure (if primary region recovers):
    1. Create new read replica: eu-central-1 ← eu-west-1
    2. Wait for replica to catch up (check replication lag)
    3. During maintenance window:
       - Fail back to eu-central-1 (promote replica)
       - Update DNS to original region
    4. Keep eu-west-1 as new DR replica
```

  Reserved for DBA: 10 connections (emergency access)

  Alert: >180 connections (90% capacity)
```

### **3.2 Availability Requirements**

**Target SLO: 99.9% (Three Nines)**

```yaml
Availability SLO: 99.9%
  Allowed Downtime: 43.8 minutes per month
  Allowed Downtime: 8.77 hours per year

  Breakdown (Target):

```

**Historical Availability Tracking:**
```sql
-- Monthly availability calculation
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', incident_start) AS month,
    SUM(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (incident_end - incident_start)) / 60) AS downtime_minutes,
    (43800 - SUM(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (incident_end - incident_start)) / 60)) / 43800 * 100 AS availability_percent
FROM incidents
WHERE incident_type = 'database_outage'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', incident_start)
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

### **3.3 Scalability Requirements**

    - Frequency: January 1st at 6:00 AM CET
    - Duration: <2 hours (500 GB migration)
```

---

## 4. Connection Management & Data Access Layer

### **4.1 Database Connection Pooling**

```yaml
Technology: Prisma (ORM) with PgBouncer (connection pooler)

PgBouncer Configuration:
  Mode: Transaction pooling (balance between session and statement)
  Max Client Connections: 200 (same as RDS limit)
  Default Pool Size: 20 per API server
  Reserve Pool: 10 connections (for superuser/DBA)
  Idle Timeout: 30 seconds
  Max Connection Age: 3600 seconds (1 hour, force reconnect)

Application Connection Pool (Prisma):
  connection_limit: 20 (per API instance)
  pool: {
    min: 5,         // Minimum idle connections
    max: 20,        // Maximum connections
    idle_timeout_ms: 30000,  // 30 seconds
    acquire_timeout_ms: 60000, // 60 seconds (wait for connection)
  }

Connection Pool Monitoring:
  CloudWatch Metric: DatabaseConnections (RDS)
  Alert: >180 connections (90% capacity)

  Query to check connections:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS active_connections
  FROM pg_stat_activity
  WHERE state = 'active';
```

### **4.2 Transaction Isolation Levels**

```yaml
Default Isolation Level: READ COMMITTED (PostgreSQL default)
  - Use for: Most queries (medication history, resident list)
  - Benefit: Better performance, no phantom reads for typical queries

Elevated Isolation Level: SERIALIZABLE
  - Use for: Medication logging (prevent duplicate logs)
  - Use for: Billing export (ensure consistent snapshot)
  - Use for: Audit log insertion (cryptographic chaining requires serialization)

  Example (Prisma):
  await prisma.$transaction(
    async (tx) => {
      // Medication log + audit log
    },
    {
      isolationLevel: 'Serializable',
      timeout: 10000, // 10 seconds
    }
  );

Transaction Timeout:
  Default: 30 seconds (prevent long-running transactions)
  Elevated: 60 seconds (for billing export)

  PostgreSQL Config:
  statement_timeout = 30000 (30 seconds)
  idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = 60000 (60 seconds)
```

### **4.3 Query Timeout & Retry Logic**

```yaml
Query Timeout:
  Application-Level: 30 seconds (Prisma middleware)
  Database-Level: 60 seconds (statement_timeout)

  Implementation (Prisma Middleware):
  prisma.$use(async (params, next) => {
    const result = await Promise.race([
      next(params),
      new Promise((_, reject) =>
        setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Query timeout')), 30000)
      ),
    ]);
    return result;
  });

Retry Logic:
  Connection Failures: Retry 3 times with exponential backoff
    - Delay: 100ms, 500ms, 2000ms
    - Use Case: Network blips, RDS failover

  Deadlocks: Retry 2 times immediately
    - Use Case: Concurrent medication logging (rare)

  Serialization Failures: Retry 2 times immediately
    - Use Case: SERIALIZABLE isolation level conflicts

  Circuit Breaker:
    - Open circuit after 10 consecutive failures
    - Half-open after 60 seconds (test with single request)
    - Close circuit after 5 successful requests
```

## 8. Capacity Planning & Scaling Triggers

### **8.1 Scaling Triggers (Automated)**

```yaml
Scale Up Database Instance:
  Trigger: CPUUtilization >70% for 15 minutes (3 consecutive checks)
  Action: db.t3.large → db.t3.xlarge (4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM)
  Downtime: <5 minutes (Multi-AZ failover)
  Cost Impact: €200 → €400/month (+€200)

Scale Up Storage:
  Trigger: FreeStorageSpace <20 GB
  Action: Auto-scale storage (100 GB → 200 GB)
  Downtime: Zero (online resize)
  Cost Impact: €12 → €24/month (+€12)

Add Read Replicas (Future):
  Trigger: ReadLatency p95 >100ms for 30 minutes
  Action: Add read replica in same region (eu-central-1)
  Use Case: Offload analytics queries from primary
  Cost Impact: +€200/month per replica
```

### **8.2 Capacity Thresholds (Manual Review)**

```yaml
Database Size:
  Current: 1 GB
  Warning: 50 GB (50% of provisioned storage)
  Action: Review storage growth rate, enable auto-scaling

Query Throughput:
  Current: 50 queries/second (average)
  Warning: 150 queries/second (3x current)
  Action: Add read replicas or scale up instance

Connection Count:
  Current: 50 connections (average)
  Warning: 150 connections (75% of limit)
  Action: Investigate connection leaks, add PgBouncer
```

## 9. Incident Response Procedures

### **9.1 Database Outage (RTO: 4 hours)**

```yaml
Severity: P0 (Critical - Patient safety impact)

Incident Response Steps:
  1. Detection (1 minute):
     - CloudWatch alarm: DatabaseConnections = 0
     - PagerDuty alert to on-call DevOps

  2. Assessment (5 minutes):
     - Check RDS console: Instance status = "Failing over"
     - Verify: Multi-AZ failover in progress (automatic)

  3. Verification (2 minutes):
     - Wait for failover completion (~2 minutes)
     - Test: SELECT 1; (confirm connectivity)
     - Check: Application health checks pass

  4. Communication (3 minutes):
     - Notify facility: "Database temporarily unavailable, restoring now"
     - Post in Slack #incidents: "RDS failover in progress, ETA 5 minutes"

  5. Resolution (5 minutes):
     - Confirm application fully operational
     - Run verify_audit_chain() (ensure data integrity)
     - Post-mortem: Document incident, root cause, prevention

  TOTAL TIME: 16 minutes (well within 4-hour RTO)
```

### **9.2 Data Corruption (RTO: 2 hours)**

```yaml
Severity: P1 (High - Data integrity compromised)

Incident Response Steps:
  1. Detection (5 minutes):
     - Daily verify_audit_chain() detects is_valid = FALSE
     - CRITICAL alert to on-call DevOps + DBA

  2. Assessment (15 minutes):
     - Identify affected rows: SELECT * FROM verify_audit_chain() WHERE NOT is_valid;
     - Check: Is corruption isolated or widespread?
     - Determine: Corruption timestamp (when did it occur?)

  3. Restore Decision (10 minutes):
     - If isolated: Restore single table from PITR
     - If widespread: Restore entire database from PITR

  4. Point-in-Time Recovery (60 minutes):
     - AWS RDS Console: Restore to timestamp (pre-corruption)
     - Create new instance: elderly-care-db-restored
     - Wait for restore completion (~30 minutes)

  5. Validation (20 minutes):
     - Run verify_audit_chain() on restored database
     - Compare row counts: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM residents;
     - Test critical queries (resident list, medication logs)

  6. Cutover (10 minutes):
     - Update DNS: elderly-care-db.example.com → restored instance
     - Restart API servers (rolling restart)
     - Monitor for errors

  7. Post-Incident (ongoing):
     - Investigate root cause (application bug? SQL injection?)
     - Implement prevention (input validation, prepared statements)

  TOTAL TIME: 120 minutes (2 hours, within RTO)
```

### **9.3 Performance Degradation (Non-Emergency)**

```yaml
Severity: P2 (Medium - Degraded user experience)

Incident Response Steps:
  1. Detection (5 minutes):
     - CloudWatch alarm: ReadLatency p95 >100ms
     - Slack #alerts-database notification

  2. Diagnosis (30 minutes):
     - Check slow query log: SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_time DESC;
     - Identify problematic query (e.g., billing export taking 5 minutes)
     - Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on slow query

  3. Quick Fix (15 minutes):
     - Add missing index: CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_missing;
     - Or: Kill long-running query: SELECT pg_cancel_backend(pid);

  4. Verification (10 minutes):
     - Re-run slow query: Verify performance improved
     - Monitor CloudWatch: ReadLatency back to <50ms

  5. Long-Term Fix (1-2 days):
     - Optimize query (rewrite SQL, add covering index)
     - Deploy fix in next release
     - Document in runbook

  TOTAL TIME: 60 minutes (1 hour)
```
