# URGENT: P0 Fix Deployed But Not Working

## Situation
- Railway deployed commit 446c0b9 successfully at 13:01:39 UTC
- Build completed successfully (26 seconds)
- TypeScript compiled to JavaScript with esbuild
- **But bookings still fail with old error: "Cannot convert undefined or null to object"**

## Evidence
- Booking #180: Created 11:02 UTC, OLD ERROR
- Booking #181: Created 11:32 UTC (just now), OLD ERROR
- All 3 email attempts failed with same error

## The Fix That Was Deployed
Location: `server/services/notificationService.ts:1618-1687`

The fix adds automatic data enrichment:
```typescript
if (notification.appointmentId) {
  console.log('ðŸ“… Enriching merge data with appointment details...');
  // Fetch appointment, doctor, patient data
  // Enrich finalMergeData with doctor_name, appointment_datetime, etc.
}
```

## Why It's Not Working

**Theory 1: Code path not being hit**
- The enrichment code might not be in the execution path
- Check: Is this code in a function that's actually called?
- Check: Are there early returns before this code?

**Theory 2: appointmentId is null/undefined**
- The condition `if (notification.appointmentId)` might be false
- Need to check what notification object looks like

**Theory 3: Error during enrichment is swallowed**
- There's a try-catch but maybe not logging errors properly
- Enrichment fails silently, returns unenriched data
- Template still fails because data is missing

## Next Steps

1. **Check Railway Deploy Logs** for console output
   - Look for "ðŸ“… Enriching merge data" message
   - Look for error messages during enrichment

2. **Add more logging** to diagnose:
   ```typescript
   console.log('DEBUG: notification object:', JSON.stringify(notification));
   console.log('DEBUG: appointmentId:', notification.appointmentId);
   console.log('DEBUG: Before enrichment, finalMergeData:', finalMergeData);
   ```

3. **Check if emails are queued vs processed**
   - The error might happen during queue creation (before enrichment)
   - Or during processing (enrichment fails)

4. **Verify the compiled JavaScript**
   - Check `dist/index.js` contains the enrichment code
   - esbuild might have issues with the compilation

## Critical Question
Where exactly is the template rendering happening? The error "Cannot convert undefined or null to object" suggests template is rendered BEFORE enrichment runs.
