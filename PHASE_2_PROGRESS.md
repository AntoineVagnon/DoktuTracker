## Session Date
2025-11-01 (Continued)

## What's Been Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Backend Infrastructure (100% Complete)

#### 1. Doctor Documents API Routes
**File Created**: `server/routes/doctorDocuments.ts`

**Endpoints Implemented**:
- `POST /api/doctor-documents/upload` - Upload documents (PDF/JPG/PNG, max 10MB)
- `GET /api/doctor-documents` - List all documents for authenticated doctor
- `GET /api/doctor-documents/:id` - Get specific document details
- `GET /api/doctor-documents/:id/download` - Get signed URL (expires in 1 hour)
- `DELETE /api/doctor-documents/:id` - Delete document
- `PATCH /api/doctor-documents/:id/verify` - Admin verify/reject document
- `GET /api/doctor-documents/doctor/:doctorId/completeness` - Check if required docs uploaded

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Multer file upload middleware
- ‚úÖ File validation (type, size)
- ‚úÖ Access control (doctors own docs, admins all docs)
- ‚úÖ Signed URL generation for secure downloads
- ‚úÖ Document verification workflow
- ‚úÖ Automatic replacement of old documents
- ‚úÖ Completeness checking

**Security**:
- ‚úÖ Authentication required
- ‚úÖ Role-based access (doctor/admin/patient)
- ‚úÖ File type validation
- ‚úÖ File size limits (10MB)
- ‚úÖ Signed URLs with expiration
- ‚úÖ Access control in service layer

#### 2. Doctor Registration Update
**File Modified**: `server/routes/doctorRegistration.ts`

**Changes**:
- ‚ùå Removed `licenseNumber` from request body

3. Doctor logs in and uploads credential documents
4. Admin reviews documents and approves/rejects
5. Account activated when documents verified
```

### üìã Routes Registration
**File Modified**: `server/routes.ts`

Added doctor documents router registration:

app.use('/api/doctor-documents', doctorDocumentsRouter);
```
