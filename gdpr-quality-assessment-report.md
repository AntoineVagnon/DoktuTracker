2. **Implement Consent Bundling**: Group related consents
3. **Add Export Functionality**: Allow users to export their processing records

### Low Priority
1. **Enhance Unicode Support**: Ensure all special characters work
2. **Add Consent Analytics**: Track consent rates and patterns
3. **Implement Consent Templates**: Pre-defined consent configurations
