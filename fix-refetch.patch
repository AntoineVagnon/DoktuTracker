The fix is to use refetchType: 'active' with invalidateQueries to force immediate refetch even with staleTime.

Change line 397 in deleteSlotRangeMutation from:
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ predicate: (query) => query.queryKey[0] === '/api/time-slots' });

To:
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ 
        predicate: (query) => query.queryKey[0] === '/api/time-slots',
        refetchType: 'active' 
      });

And same for deleteSlotMutation at line 377.
