# 5-Minute Email Reminder Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED AND DEPLOYED
**Commit:** 1991dad
**Related Commits:** dd4ff45 (duplicate banner fix), 357b43b (30-min duration fix)

## Issue Summary

**User Report:** "I still don't get the reminder 5 min before appointment"

**Problem:** Users were receiving green in-app banner notifications 5 minutes before appointments, but **no email notifications** were being sent.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Process

1. **Checked Cron Job Configuration** (`server/cron/appointmentReminders.ts:177-250`)
   - ‚úÖ `startImminentNotifications()` cron job **IS configured** and runs every minute
   - ‚úÖ Finds appointments 5-6 minutes away
   - ‚úÖ Schedules `BOOKING_LIVE_IMMINENT` (B6) notifications
   - ‚úÖ Properly initialized in `server/index.ts:15-32`

2. **Examined Notification Service** (`server/services/notificationService.ts`)
   - Found channel configuration in `getChannelsForTrigger()` function
   - **Root Cause Identified:** Line 853 explicitly excluded `BOOKING_LIVE_IMMINENT` from email channel

### The Bug

```typescript
// BEFORE (Line 850-855):
// Email channel (most notifications)
if (prefs.emailEnabled) {
  channels.email = ![
    TriggerCode.BOOKING_LIVE_IMMINENT,  // ‚ùå EXCLUDED FROM EMAIL
    TriggerCode.HEALTH_PROFILE_COMPLETED
  ].includes(triggerCode);
}
```

**Why This Was Wrong:**
- 5-minute reminder was only sent via SMS + in-app banner
- Email channel was intentionally disabled for this trigger
- This was likely a design decision assuming SMS would be sufficient
- However, users expect email notifications for all appointment reminders

---

## The Fix

### Code Change

**File:** `server/services/notificationService.ts:850-855`

```typescript
// AFTER:
// Email channel (most notifications)
if (prefs.emailEnabled) {
  channels.email = ![
    TriggerCode.HEALTH_PROFILE_COMPLETED // In-app only
  ].includes(triggerCode);
}
```

**What Changed:**
- Removed `TriggerCode.BOOKING_LIVE_IMMINENT` from email exclusion list
- Now 5-minute reminders are sent via **email + SMS + in-app banner**

---

## How It Works Now

### Complete 5-Minute Reminder Flow

1. **Cron Job Execution** (every minute via `startImminentNotifications()`)
   ```typescript
   // Finds appointments 5-6 minutes away
   const in5Minutes = new Date(now.getTime() + 5 * 60 * 1000);
   const in6Minutes = new Date(now.getTime() + 6 * 60 * 1000);

   // Queries for paid/confirmed appointments
   where(
     and(
       gte(appointments.appointmentDate, in5Minutes),
       lt(appointments.appointmentDate, in6Minutes),
       or(eq(appointments.status, 'paid'), eq(appointments.status, 'confirmed'))
     )
   )
   ```

2. **Notification Scheduling**
   ```typescript
   await notificationService.scheduleNotification({
     userId: appointment.patientId,
     appointmentId: appointment.id,
     triggerCode: TriggerCode.BOOKING_LIVE_IMMINENT,
     scheduledFor: new Date(),
     mergeData: {
       patient_first_name: appointment.patientFirstName,
       doctor_name: `Dr. ${doctorDetails.lastName}`,
       join_link: `${process.env.CLIENT_URL}/appointments/${appointment.id}/join`
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Channel Distribution** (after fix)
   - ‚úÖ **Email:** booking_live_imminent template
   - ‚úÖ **SMS:** Text message with join link (if phone number available)
   - ‚úÖ **In-app Banner:** Green "starting soon" banner
   - ‚úÖ **In-app Inbox:** Notification in user's inbox

4. **Immediate Processing**
   ```typescript
   // Immediate processing after scheduling (lines 647-655)
   await this.processPendingNotifications();
   ```

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case: 5-Minute Email Reminder

**Prerequisites:**
- User with valid email address
- Confirmed appointment (status = 'paid')
- Email preferences enabled
- Appointment scheduled 5+ minutes in future

**Expected Behavior:**
1. At T-5 minutes, cron job triggers
2. Email notification sent to patient
3. Green banner appears on dashboard
4. SMS sent (if phone number available)
5. Notification appears in inbox

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check email_notifications table for BOOKING_LIVE_IMMINENT
SELECT * FROM email_notifications
WHERE trigger_code = 'B6'
AND user_id = [PATIENT_ID]
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Expected: status = 'sent', sent_at = recent timestamp
```
