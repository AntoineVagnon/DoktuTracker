## üìù Notes

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Doctor profile created successfully
- ‚úÖ Authentication working via test endpoint
- ‚úÖ Appears in doctors list API
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No availability slots (availableSlots: 0)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Title field is null (should be "Dr.")

### Known Issues
1. **Title Field:** The `title` field in the users table is `null`. This was not set during creation because the `users` table doesn't receive the title field from the doctor creation API.

2. **No Availabilities:** The doctor has no time slots created yet. To make the doctor bookable:
   - Log in as the test doctor
   - Navigate to availability management
   - Create some time slots

3. **Specialty vs Specialization:** The database uses `specialty` but the frontend form uses `specialization`. This is handled correctly in the backend.
