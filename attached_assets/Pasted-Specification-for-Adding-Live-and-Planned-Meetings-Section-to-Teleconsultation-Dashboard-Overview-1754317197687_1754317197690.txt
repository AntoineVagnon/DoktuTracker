Specification for Adding "Live and Planned Meetings" Section to Teleconsultation Dashboard

Overview

This specification outlines the requirements for adding a new section titled "Live and Planned Meetings" to the existing teleconsultation platform dashboard. The section is designed for customer support to monitor all live (ongoing) and planned (upcoming) meetings in real-time and check their status. The dashboard is built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js, and this new section must integrate seamlessly with the existing design and functionality. The platform operates without a ticketing system, so the focus is on meeting data and status tracking. The specification ensures alignment with the Product-Led Growth (PLG) approach, emphasizing the North Star metric: number of rendez-vous réservés.

The section will provide a clear, interactive interface for customer support to quickly assess meeting statuses, identify issues (e.g., delays or technical problems), and take action to ensure a smooth user experience, thereby supporting the platform’s growth objectives.
