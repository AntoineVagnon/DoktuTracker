2. Re-framed dashboard hierarchy
North-star = “Appointments Booked”
All supporting metrics should answer why that number is moving.

2.1 Top bar – snapshots (always visible)
Tile	Formula & notes	Default comparison
Appointments Booked	Count of confirmed + paid consults in window	vs. previous equivalent window
Unique Active Patients	Distinct patient IDs with ≥1 booking	vs. last period
Bookings / Active Patient	Appointments ÷ active patients	goals: ≥1.4/mo
Doctor Utilisation (%)	Booked slots ÷ total offered slots	warning <60 %
Net Revenue €	Fees collected – refunds	spark-line 30 d
Churn Risk Patients	Patients × (no booking in 90 d)	absolute count

All tiles change colour when pre-set thresholds are crossed (green / amber / red).

2.2 Conversion funnel panel
Stage	Definition	Drop-off alert
Visitors	Site users with >1 page view	—
Doctor Interest	Clicked to doctor profile	>40 % ctr-dip
Slot Selection	Reached booking widget	“<30 %”
Payment Initiated	Entered checkout	payment error spike
Confirmed	Payment succeeded	—
Completed	Zoom status = “ended”	no-show >10 %

Stacked horizontal bars with % labels; click a stage to open side panel with segment filter (device, geo, traffic source if available).

2.3 Patient cohort cards (value tiers)
Replace the colour-coded cards in your mock-ups with simpler heat-map blocks.

Fields per card:

Segment name (VIP, Premium, etc.)

Patients (#) – badge

LTV € – large text

Appointments / Patient

Churn risk count – red pill

Clicking a card opens a lightweight table of patients (name, last visit, spend, status) but does not expose raw PII unless the viewer has “Admin” role.

2.4 Doctor roster list
Add two coloured tags per doctor row:

Availability % (rolling 30 d)
Green ≥80 / Amber 60-79 / Red <60

Cancellation %
Red badge >10 %

Row action menu:

View profile card (read-only)

Open doctor calendar (for Ops manager)

Reset password link

Disable online status (soft hide)

2.5 Appointment pipeline chart
Keep the temporal line-chart but:

Default window = last 7 days, quick-switch “7 d / 30 d / Custom”.

Hover = exact counts + Δ vs. previous equal interval.

Stacked area instead of multiple separate lines to improve visual density.

Add a mini-table below with:

Avg payment failure rate %

Avg time doctor joins (mins after start)

No-show rate %

2.6 Action shortcuts (light-weight, no heavy CRUD)
Add Doctor – opens modal (name, email, specialty, base fee).

Create Discount Code – short modal (value, expiry, usage cap).

Send Password Reset – one-click, confirmation toast.

Join Meeting as Support – only visible for live sessions in pipeline panel.

3. Edge-case UX rules
Scenario	Dashboard response
Data delay >4 h	Thin yellow banner “Data currently delayed – last update HH:MM UTC”.
Metric fetch fails	Widget greys out with retry icon; does not block whole page.
Privacy role mismatch	Any row/action requiring higher privilege is hidden (not just disabled).
Rapid KPI spike (e.g., refund flood)	Red toast “Refund rate >X % in last hour” appears; toast links to filtered refunds table.

4. Updated Gherkin user stories

Feature: Admin growth dashboard loads core KPIs

Scenario: First load
  Given I am an admin or growth user
  When I open “Home → Admin Dashboard”
  Then I see six KPI tiles:
    | Appointments | Active Patients | Bookings per Patient | Utilisation | Net Revenue | Churn Risk |
  And each tile compares current window to the previous one
  And the window defaults to “Last 7 days”

Scenario: Change time window
  When I switch the date selector to “Last 30 days”
  Then every metric, chart and table refreshes to that period
  And the comparison delta updates accordingly

Scenario: Doctor utilisation drops below threshold
  Given Doctor Utilisation < 60 %
  Then the tile background turns amber
  And a tooltip explains “Low slot fill – consider promo push”

Scenario: Click funnel stage
  Given I click the “Slot Selection” bar in the funnel
  Then a side panel opens showing:
    | Device | Visitors | Conversion to Payment |
  And filters persist until cleared

Scenario: Add new doctor
  When I click “Add Doctor”
  And submit the form with valid details
  Then the doctor roster adds a new row with status “pending setup”
  And an invitation email is queued

Scenario: Data fetch failure
  Given the revenue API is unreachable
  When the dashboard loads
  Then the Net Revenue tile shows “N/A” and a retry icon
  And other tiles still render normally
