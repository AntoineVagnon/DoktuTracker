# Doctor Dashboard â€” Unified Navigation & Layout Redesign

## Feature: Unified navigation experience for doctors

  As a doctor
  I want to navigate between dashboard sections via a single sidebar
  So that the interface remains consistent across all pages and devices

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a doctor

  ## Main Dashboard Layout

  Scenario: Display updated main dashboard layout
    When I access the main dashboard
    Then I should see a greeting message "Welcome back James" without the title "Dr."
    And I should only see one button labeled "View Calendar"
    And the quick actions section should not be visible
    And the main navigation should be visible as a vertical sidebar

  ## Navigation structure (desktop)

  Scenario: Replace top navigation and quick actions with vertical sidebar
    Given I am on any page of the doctor dashboard
    Then I should see a vertical sidebar on the left containing:
      | Dashboard         |
      | Calendar          |
      | Patient Records   |
      | Settings          |
    And the current active page should be clearly highlighted
    And the sidebar should remain persistent during navigation

  ## Navigation on mobile

  Scenario: Collapse sidebar on mobile
    Given I am on a mobile device
    Then the vertical sidebar should be collapsed by default
    And I should see a hamburger menu to open it
    And the menu should contain the same navigation links

  ## Settings page layout

  Scenario: Display sub-sections in Settings page
    Given I access the "Settings" page
    Then I should see the following sub-sections as horizontal tabs:
      | My Profile               |
      | Professional Information |
      | Payment Methods          |
      | Security                 |
    And the first visible tab should be "My Profile"

  ## Edge case: direct sub-page access

  Scenario: Ensure navigation consistency when accessing sub-page directly
    Given I open a sub-page like "/doctor-settings" directly
    Then the main sidebar should still be visible
    And the active page in the sidebar should be highlighted as "Settings"
    And the correct horizontal sub-tab should be selected

  ## Future-proofing (optional)

  Scenario: Make sidebar extensible
    Then the sidebar design should allow for future entries like:
      | Analytics         |
      | Notifications     |
