Quick diagnosis

Discoverability is low (floating popover in the avatar area).

Copy is ambiguous: “3 of 3 remaining • Available” + a bar with “0/3” is hard to parse.

Not connected to key actions (Book, Calendar, Empty state).

Product goals

Clarity at-a-glance → Nudge to use credits → Zero surprises (billing/depletion) → Consistency across pages → Accessible.

UI recommendations (where & how)
1) App header (always visible)

Inline Usage Chip next to the “Book New Appointment” CTA:
● 3 credits left • Resets Sep 30

Chip shows number first (what users care about), not a fraction.

When ≤1 credit: chip turns warning color and adds Last credit.

When 0: chip turns danger and the Book button text changes to Add credits to book.

Popover on chip click/hover (progressive disclosure):

Plan name + cycle dates

Usage meter (3 used of 3 / 0 left) with textual label for accessibility

Next reset + next charge date (if paid)

Actions: Manage plan, Usage history, Add credits

Secondary: FAQs link

2) Appointments > Empty state

Replace the single empty card with a value-oriented empty state:

Illustration + line: “You have 3 credits ready — book your next visit in 2 minutes.”

Primary: Book an appointment (same CTA) with a small badge “3”.

Secondary: See doctors (if that’s a separate list).

If 0 credits: copy flips to “No credits left” + Add credits (primary) and Browse doctors (secondary).

3) “Book New Appointment” flow

Pre-flight banner at the top of the modal/flow:

3 credits left • Resets in 12 days

If 0: show inline paywall card with two options: Add credits or One-off purchase. Don’t dead-end the user.

On confirmation screen: subtle “This will use 1 credit” line.

4) Settings tab → “Membership & Billing”

Full page with: plan, cycle, payment method, invoices, usage history, add/remove credits, upgrade/downgrade.

Widget anatomy (spec)

Chip states

Default: ● {n} credits left

Low (≤1): ● Last credit

Depleted: ● 0 credits • Add credits

Progress indicator

Linear bar with text: Used 0 of 3 (never rely on color alone).

SR-only label: “You have 3 monthly credits; 0 used; resets Sep 30.”

Color tokens

Neutral for default, Warning for low, Danger for 0; keep WCAG AA contrast.

Copy improvements

Replace “3 of 3 remaining • Available” with “3 credits left”.

Replace “Reset on Sep 30” with “Resets Sep 30” (and countdown on hover: “in 12 days”).

Payment failure state: “Payment issue — update card to keep booking.”

UX behaviors & edge cases

Trial: “Trial • 3 credits left • Ends Sep 30.”

Rollover (if supported): show 3 left (1 rollover).

Family/Employer plans: show payer tag (e.g., “Covered by ACME Corp”) and what’s included.

Doctor exceptions (if some consume 2 credits): warn at selection: “This visit uses 2 credits.”

Grace period: if cycle ended but appointment already booked, do not block; communicate clearly.

Notifications (lightweight)

In-app toast after booking: “Booked — 2 credits left.”

When 1 credit left: dismissible banner in dashboard for that session.

72h before reset & you still have credits: subtle reminder (“Book before reset?”) — never spam.

Accessibility & internationalization

Bar + numeric labels (not color-only).

Announce changes (ARIA live) when credits update after booking.

Localize dates (“30 Sep” vs “Sep 30”) and pluralization (“1 credit left”).

Performance & responsive

Chip collapses to an icon with 3 badge on mobile; full text in popover.

Keep all membership data in one lightweight request cached in context; update optimistically after booking.

Metrics to track

Chip CTR, popover CTR → Manage plan CTR

Book CTA CTR when credits >0 vs =0

Conversion on Add credits / One-off

Drop-offs after paywall

Support tickets about billing/limits (should fall).
