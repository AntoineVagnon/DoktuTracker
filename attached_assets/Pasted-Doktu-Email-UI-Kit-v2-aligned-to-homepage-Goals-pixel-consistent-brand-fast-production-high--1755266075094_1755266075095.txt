Doktu Email UI Kit — v2 (aligned to homepage)

Goals: pixel-consistent brand, fast production, high inbox placement, perfect readability on mobile, and minimal image dependency.

1) Brand tokens (email-safe)

These mirror your homepage but are tuned for email legibility and dark-mode. If any color feels off once you set the final palette, just replace the HEX in one place.

Token	Purpose	Default (Light)	Dark-mode
--brand-primary	Buttons/links	#2563EB (blue-600)	#7AB5FF
--brand-primary-strong	Emphasis accents	#1D4ED8 (blue-700)	#9CC7FF
--brand-gradient-start	Optional hero stripe	#2B6AFB	same as primary
--brand-gradient-end	Optional hero stripe	#1E40AF	lighten 20%
--accent-success	Success chips/icons	#16A34A	#68D391
--accent-warning	Time-sensitive notices	#F59E0B	#F6C453
--accent-danger	Payment/critical	#EF4444	#F87171
--text-primary	Body copy	#0B1220	#F4F6FA
--text-secondary	Muted copy	#556070	#B8C0CC
--bg-surface	Card/body	#FFFFFF	#0E1116
--bg-muted	Section rows	#F6F7FB	#151A22
--border-soft	Dividers/keys	#E7EBF0	#2A3340
--focus-ring	Focus halo	#93C5FD	#60A5FA

If you later confirm your official HEX values, we’ll swap them 1:1 here.

Type & layout

Font: system stack (-apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif)

Container: max 600px, fluid on mobile

Heading scale: H1 22/28, H2 18/24, body 16/24, small 14/20

Radius: 12px cards, 10px buttons

Shadow: very soft 0 1px 2px rgba(16,24,40,.06)

2) Components (email-safe, image-light)

All components render clean even with images off and in dark mode.

Header

Left-aligned logo (PNG/SVG light & dark)

Optional preheader hidden line for preview text

Hero stripe (marketing only)

Email prefers solid color; gradients are fine but keep live text, no big hero images

Use a single CTA

Section title

H1/H2 + short one-line lead

Blue underline 24px (CSS border) for visual echo of site

Key-facts row (transactional workhorse)

Inline emoji + label:
📅 Tue, 1 Oct · 10:00 CET | 👨‍⚕️ Dr. Rodriguez (Pediatrics) | 🔗 Join

Stacks to 3 lines on mobile

Primary CTA (bulletproof button)

Filled, --brand-primary, white text, 16px padding, 10px radius

Max one per email; everything else becomes text links

Secondary links row

Muted text links (e.g., Reschedule · Cancel · View in dashboard)

Info card

Soft gray background --bg-muted, border --border-soft, small icon (optional), 12px radius

Use for Guidelines, Refund policy, Security note

Doctor mini-card (marketing/newsletter only)

Initials circle (no image dependency), name, specialty, “View profile” link

Pricing bullets (marketing)

3-5 bullet rows with emoji checkmarks; no full pricing tables in transactional

Footer

Support email, minimal legal links, postal address

Unsubscribe for marketing; no unsubscribe on transactional

3) Patterns that match the homepage

Tone: warm, confident, succinct; one clear action per email.

Iconography: email-safe emoji (📅, 👨‍⚕️, 💳, 🔒) rather than inline SVG.

Cards & pills: subtle shadows, rounded corners (12px), generous whitespace.

Gradient look: emulate with solid branding + thin accent borders (deliverability-friendly).

4) Accessibility & deliverability guardrails

Live text for all critical info; alt text for any icon

Contrast ≥ 4.5:1 in both modes

HTML size < 100KB; minimal inline CSS; compress assets

Limit link count; 1 primary CTA

Always ship plain-text alternative

Attach .ics only for confirm/reschedule/cancel (ADD/UPDATE/CANCEL)

DKIM/SPF/DMARC aligned (handled by infra), consistent From/Sender

Avoid all-image hero; avoid tracking pixels outside ESP defaults

Localize times explicitly (e.g., Tue, 1 Oct 2025 · 10:00 CET)

5) Template blueprints (map to your notifications)

Each uses the same Master Frame: Header → Title/Lead → Key-Facts (if relevant) → CTA → Secondary Links → Info Card (optional) → Footer.

Welcome (patient/doctor)
Title + lead, one CTA (Complete Profile / Go to Dashboard)

Booking confirmation
Key-facts row (date, doctor, join), CTA Join Consultation, Info card “Read guidelines”; .ics attached

Reminders (24h / 1h)
Key-facts, CTA Join, secondary Reschedule/Cancel; .ics refresh

Reschedule/Cancel confirmation
Plain title (“Your consultation was rescheduled/cancelled”), 1 supportive link (Rebook), .ics add/remove

Profile/documents nudges
Short copy + CTA Complete Health Profile or Upload Documents

Post-call survey
Stars row (accessible labels) + CTA Rate your consultation

(These remain consistent with your earlier notification matrix.)

6) Dark-mode specifics

Invert logo automatically; swap --text-primary/secondary to light

Borders become deeper (--border-soft → #2A3340)

Buttons lighten text & focus ring for clarity

7) Gherkin checks (design acceptance)
Feature: Email Master Frame parity with homepage brand

Scenario: Visual parity without images
  Given images are blocked by the client
  When any Doktu email is opened
  Then the brand color, spacing, and typography remain consistent
  And all critical details (date, time, doctor, CTA) are visible as live text

Scenario: Mobile readability
  When viewing at 320px width
  Then headings wrap without clipping
  And the Key-Facts row stacks to 3 readable lines
  And the primary CTA remains at least 44px tap-height

Scenario: Single action focus
  When rendering transactional emails
  Then there is exactly one primary CTA
  And all other actions are plain text links

Scenario: Dark-mode compliance
  When a client forces dark mode
  Then contrast is ≥ 4.5:1 for text vs background
  And the dark logo variant is displayed

Scenario: ICS correctness
  When sending confirmation, reschedule, or cancellation emails
  Then an appropriate ICS file is attached
  And the ICS method matches the action (ADD/REQUEST, REPLY/UPDATE, CANCEL)

8) What I still need from you (we’ll ship with safe defaults until then)

Brand HEX (if you want exact homepage blue/gradient)

Legal footer: company name + postal address + links (Privacy, Terms)

Locales: confirm if/when you want RTL (ar/he). The kit supports it; we’ll flip layout and icons spacing.

9) Quick visual cues for copywriters (email-ready, homepage aligned)

Use short, confident headlines:
“Book in under 2 minutes.”
“Your consultation is confirmed.”
“One step left: complete your health profile.”

Prefer 3-bullet value lists with emoji, not dense paragraphs.

Keep to one primary action per message.
